### A simple one file introduction to the new stuff in ES2015/typescript

 - Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) for the best experience although other IDEs have good support for [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as well.
 - Install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) - a light weight http server on your sandbox
 - Run the server and go to ** localhost:port ** and check the console to see the logs 
 - You could also install typescript compiler by `npm install -g typescript` and then run the compiler by `tsc -w`
 - `tsc -w` runs the compiler in watch mode looking for your file changes
 - If you don't supply a file name, it would get the configuration from a file called `tsconfig.json` in your current directory.
 - Check our the file in this project for the config format
